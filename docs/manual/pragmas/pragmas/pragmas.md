## Pragmas

Pragmas are Nim\'s method to give the compiler additional information /
commands without introducing a massive number of new keywords. Pragmas
are processed on the fly during semantic checking. Pragmas are enclosed
in the special `{.` and `.}` curly brackets. Pragmas are also often used
as a first implementation to play with a language feature before a nicer
syntax to access the feature becomes available.
